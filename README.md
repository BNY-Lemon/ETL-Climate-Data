## ETL: Climate Data Analysis
### Summary
We are interested in laying to rest the age old question: is climate change real, and if so, what is the cause? Many experts agree that the rise of carbon emissions is a large contributor to climate change. With this in mind, we will find, clean, and analyze US climate and global emissions data for several decades and analyze any trends that may be available. We will use a combination of multiple data sources and data science tools (Python, Jupyter Notebook, SQL, Matplotlib) to help us extract, transform and load these data into a final production database.

Methodology:
============

## 1. Finding the Data
We will pull data from online sources via API on (1) national temperature changes over time, (2) global CO2 emissions, and (3), time permitting, historic intensity of meteorological disasters in the US.

## 2. Data Cleanup & Analysis
We will transfer the data through pandas to a SQL database and analyze correlations between the various tables.
